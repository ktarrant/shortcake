## Collision Masking

ðŸ§± Collision Layers and Masks
| Layer | Name             | Used By               | Purpose / Notes                                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `Player`         | Player bodies         | Charactersâ€™ physical bodies (no mutual collision) |
| 2     | `SolidPlatform`  | Main platform         | Solid ground â€” cannot fall through                |
| 3     | `OneWayPlatform` | Top platforms         | One-way pass-through platforms                    |
| 4     | `OverlapArea`    | Area2D inside players | Soft collision detection between players          |

âœ… Collision Mask Configuration
| Node Type              | Layer(s) | Mask(s) | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Player`               | 1        | 2, 3    | Collides with ground and one-way platforms only |
| `OverlapArea` (Area2D) | 4        | 1       | Detects overlap with other players              |
| `SolidPlatform`        | 2        | â€”       | Standard ground â€” blocks movement               |
| `OneWayPlatform`       | 3        | â€”       | One-way platform â€” supports drop-through        |

ðŸ”„ Special Logic
- When player falls through:
	set_collision_mask_value(3, false) (disable one-way platform collision)

- On landing:
	set_collision_mask_value(3, true) (restore platform collision)

# TODO
